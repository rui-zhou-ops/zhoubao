# Summary

last week question 

1. Allan variance:

   Used for quantitative analysis of the random noise characteristics and to model the random noise.

   Let's look at some classic allan variances:

   2、Thermal-Inertial Odometry（TIO）

   It is a positioning and mapping method that combines thermal imaging and inertial measurement.

   Last week had three questions:

   ①How does TLO produce images？

   TLO uses infrared thermal radiation reflected by objects to generate images. Any object with a temperature above absolute zero (0 K, -273.15°C) emits infrared radiation, whose intensity and wavelength distribution are determined by the temperature of the object's surface. Finally,Thermal imaging devices convert infrared radiation into electrical signals and generate a visible image through false-color processing (such as brighter colors with higher heat).

   ②What is the infrared wavelength？

   The wavelength range is 0.7 μm to 1000 μm.

   ③Why can thermal imaging "through" through objects?

   Some objects absorb less infrared light, allowing infrared radiation to pass through, and thermal imaging can capture these thermal radiation after passing through the material.

   Second, some objects have a temperature difference between the surface and the heat source behind them, which reflects the heat source inside.

   Third, infrared radiation can through smoke, dust and dark environments, because these media scatter and absorb less infrared light. 
# Plan 
1、Learn C++.

2、Read paper![image-20241115194953197](C:\Users\19110\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20241115194953197.png)and prepare ppt  presentation.

# Problem
1. The profile may not be complete when the algorithm is derived.
