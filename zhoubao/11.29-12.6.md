# Summary

last week question 

1. Infrared camera and thermal camera difference:

   The main difference between the two cameras is the wavelength of light captured by the sensor.<img src="D:/github/cangku/zhoubao/image/142c65d17d7f83091896f2b2dc0acee7.png" alt="img" style="zoom:50%;" />

   Infrared images can be obtained by adding filters to ordinary cameras.Thermal camare is mainly used to measure temperature.The infrared camera is mainly to achieve night vision function, is active infrared imaging and thermal camera is passive infrared.

   Active infrared is to achieve the purpose of seeing objects at night by emitting infrared sources to increase the brightness of the outside world by tens of thousands of times. Passive infrared is found through the infrared characteristics of the object itself, and generally objects that exceed the natural temperature have infrared characteristics.

   This is an example about infrared camare:

2. Thermal camare measuring distance:

   The detection range of infrared thermal imager is affected by many factors. For example, the resolution of the device, the focal length of the lens, environmental conditions, and so on.For most commercial thermal cameras, the measuring distance is usually between a few meters and tens of meters.For some high-end ones, the measured distance is probably a few hundred meters to a few kilometers.

   ### 公式

   探测距离 = (目标尺寸 * 镜头焦距) / 分辨率

   

   This week I read the English review and summarized the relevant content of the review.
