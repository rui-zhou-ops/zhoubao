# Summary
​    Because of low-cost MEMS inertial sensors’ measurements are inevitably corrupted by various error sources, leading to unbounded drifts when integrated doubly in traditional inertial navigation algorithms, subjecting inertial positioning to the problem of error drifts.To address the impact of measurement errors, the powerful nonlinear approximator capabilities of deep neural networks can be exploited. This survey explores the application of deep learning in inertial positioning about the sensor level, algorithm level and application level. We learned some approaches about deep learning how improve inertial position.

1. At the sensor level, deep learning is employed as a calibration method for inertial sensors. It effectively models error sources in inertial measurements and implicitly eliminates corrupted measurement errors and noise.

   In recent years, there has been increasing interest in using deep neural networks (DNN) with multiple layers to solve the inertial sensor calibration problem.We can use a Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet)  to remove error noises from inertial measurements.

   In addition to directly learning from pseudo ground-truth IMU labels, another approach is to enable neural network based calibration models to produce inertial data that can be integrated into more accurate orientation estimation.

   Third,we can use deep learning to generate parameters that improve classical calibration algorithms.

2. At the algorithm level, deep neural networks are constructed to partially or completely replace modules in traditional inertial navigation mechanisms that enhance and correct IMU integration in general. 

   We can use deep learning to construct inertial position models replace classical inertial navigation mechanisms.One models aims to learn location displacement.Another model aims to learn velocity to calibrate accelerations.

   An alternative approach involves incorporating learned velocity into the updating process of a Kalman filter (KF).

   In order to solve the orientation dependedce of position,IDOL proposes a two-stage process that first learns orientation from data and  then rotates inertial data into the appropriate frame, followed by learning the position.

3. At the application level, main introduce specific use cases where deep learning methods can be applied to inertial positioning for pedestrians, vehicles, drones, and robots. 

   (1)*Learning Based Visual-Inertial Positioning*

   Deep learning-based VIO models have emerged, directly constructing a mapping function from images and IMU to pose in a data-driven manner.

   To effectively integrate visual and inertial information, one approach proposes a selective sensor fusion mechanism that learns to choose important features conditioned on sensor observations,it proposes two types of fusion:soft fusion and hard fusion.In order to save money ,Self-supervised VIOs proposes do not require pose labels, have attracted attention.

   (2)*Learning Based IMU/GNSS Integrated Positioning*

   One approach propose a tight-integration of GNSS and INS by converting INS information into Doppler data and integrating it with GNSS tracking loops to mitigate Doppler effects on the GNSS signal.

   In scenarios where GNSS signals are absent, [97]([97] S. Lu, Y. Gong, H. Luo, F. Zhao, Z. Li, and J. Jiang, “Heteroge neous multi-task learning for multiple pseudo-measurement estimation to bridge GPS outaes,” IEEE Trans. Instrum. Meas., vol. 70, pp. 1–16, 2021)proposes a multi-task learning method.

   To refine the parameters used in filtering, [99] (F. Wu, H. Luo, H. Jia, F. Zhao, Y. Xiao, and X. Gao, “Predicting the noise covariance with a multitask learning model for Kalman filter based GNSS/INS integrated navigation,” *IEEE Trans. Instrum. Meas.*,vol. 70, pp. 1–13, 2021.)introduces temporal convolutional neural (TCN) based framework that not only learns the parameters of measurement noise covariances but also the parameters of process noise covariances, resulting in higher position accuracy compared to classical INS/GNSS integrated positioning systems.
