# Summary

last week question 

1. thermal-inertial odometry is a visual inertial odometer method combining thermal imaging and inertial measurement unit (IMU) data. It is mainly used for positioning and navigation in low-light or completely dark environments (such as darkness, smoke, dust)

2. Allan variance method is a statistical method  used to analyze and quantify the noise characteristics of time series. Especially suitable for the noise analysis of inertial sensors such as gyroscopes and accelerometers. It can help identify and separate different types of noise, such as white noise, Bias Instability, random walks, etc.

   This week 

   Mainly learn about KF used in pure Inertial positioning.

   Since pure inertial navigation has no external information, KF needs to build a state vector based on IMU data and because pure inertial navigation has no external observation information ,so the observational model for KF is simple.
# Plan 
2. Keep running algorithm.
# Problem
1. Use VSC++ to run the algorithm has many problems, including the downloaded dataset format MAT,fail to convert to the dataset.txt file , has not been solved.
1. Downloading the eigen library using C++ presents a number of problems.
1. The algorithm hasn't worked yet.
